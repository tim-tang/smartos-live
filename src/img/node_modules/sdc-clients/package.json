For\ncontribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main\n[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.\n\nNode.js client libraries for the various SDC REST API services: Amon, CA,\nCNAPI, NAPI, UFDS, Packages on top of UFDS and VMAPI so far.\n\n## Testing\n\nShort version:\n\n    make test\n\nOf course, you may want to read some assumptions we made in order to ensure\nthe previous `make test` will run successfully.\n\nCurrently, every `test/*.test.js` file can be run separately as a different\ntest suite by issuing the proper commands:\n\n    AMON_IP=10.99.99.20 \\\n    MACHINE_UUID=f56dbb40-1c81-4047-9d56-73fc3adf2b99 \\\n    make amon_test\n\n    CA_IP=10.99.99.24 make ca_test\n\n    make cnapi_test\n\n    make ufds_test\n\n    make package_test\n\n    make vmapi_test\n\n    make napi_test\n\n    make imgapi_test\n\n    make papi_test\n\nEach one of this commands assumes you've got a running version of the proper\nAPI service.\n\nFor every service, the following environment variables can be provided to\nindicate the IP addresses where these services are running:\n\n    AMON_IP\n    CA_IP\n    CNAPI_IP\n    UFDS_IP\n    VMAPI_IP\n    NAPI_IP\n    PAPI_IP\n\nOf course, you provide each one of these environment variables to the proper\ntest suite make command and, in case you plan to run `make test`, i.e, all the\ntest suites, you may want to provide all these environment variables.\n\nAlso, note that `amon` test suite requires the UUID of a real machine to be\ngiven as environment variable in order to be able to create real machine\nprobes (`MACHINE_UUID` env var).\n\nGiven UFDS, CNAPI, NAPI and VMAPI are services provided by the default headnode\ncore zones, if the associated IP env variables are not provided, the test\nsuites will set them to the default values into a COAL image running the\nheadnode; that is:\n\n    CNAPI_IP=10.99.99.18\n    UFDS_IP=10.99.99.14\n    VMAPI_IP=10.99.99.22\n    NAPI_IP=10.99.99.10\n    AMON_IP=10.99.99.20\n    CA_IP=10.99.99.25\n    PAPI_IP=10.99.99.30\n\nThere are no default values pointing to the headnode zones for AMON and CA.\nThe default test values for these APIs point to `localhost` so, you may want\nto either run them locally or pass in the values for these zones IPs.\n\nSo, in brief, requirements to run these test suites:\n\n- Headnode setup, including AMON and CA zones. \n- Run the following command:\n\n    CNAPI_IP=10.99.99.18 \\\n    VMAPI_IP=10.99.99.22 \\\n    UFDS_IP=10.99.99.14 \\\n    NAPI_IP=10.99.99.10 \\\n    CA_IP=10.99.99.25 \\\n    AMON_IP=10.99.99.20 \\\n    PAPI_IP=10.99.99.30 \\\n    MACHINE_UUID=f56dbb40-1c81-4047-9d56-73fc3adf2b99 \\\n    make test\n\nwith the different IP env vars pointing to the right IP for each zone.\n\nNote that it's also possible to pass the ENV variable `ADMIN_PWD` to be used\nwith UFDS authentication tests. When not given, it will default to the\n_traditional_ `joypass123`.\n",
